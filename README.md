# TPS-Machine-Learning

## This repository contains types for machine learning, Specially, I want to say two essential areas: 

First, supervise learning such as: 

## 1- Linear Regression example.

## 2- Polynomial Regression and Multiple Regression.

## 3- Logistic Regression (classification).

Second, Unsupervised Learning like: 

## 4- Na√Øve Bayes algorithms.

## 5- SVM

## 6- Random Forest 

## 7- Decision tree.

## 8- K-NN

## 9- K-Means

Brief, All this TPS as far as implementing examples of each type are concerned.

### We also share examples of NLP implementation : 
## Natural Language Processing.
## The Implementation of Descent Gradient Algorithm for assigning best model parameters...

Others...
